# PLAN2 - Procedural City Generation Script - COMPLETED ✅

**Status**: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
**Date**: September 18, 2025
**Next Step**: Execute PLAN3 for WASM simulation core

## Summary

The procedural city generation system has been successfully implemented and tested. The system generates complete, believable city models with zones, roads, POIs, and buildings, serialized to Protocol Buffers binary format for efficient use by simulation and visualization systems.

## Implemented Files

### Core System Files
- `src/data/city_model.proto` - Protocol Buffers schema defining the city data structure
- `src/data/city_model.js` - Compiled JavaScript protobuf classes
- `src/data/city_model.d.ts` - TypeScript definitions for protobuf classes
- `scripts/generate_city.cjs` - Main city generation script using CommonJS modules
- `public/model.pbf` - Generated binary city model file (48KB)

### Package Configuration
- Updated `package.json` with new scripts:
  - `prebuild`: Runs city generation and WASM build
  - `build:city`: Generates the city model
  - `protoc`: Compiles protobuf schema

## Generated City Statistics

**Latest Generation Results**:
- **Zones**: 16 (1 downtown, 6 residential, 4 commercial, 2 industrial, 3 parks)
- **Roads**: 104 (1 highway, 13 arterial, 90 local)
- **POIs**: 420 (147 homes, 132 shops, 59 restaurants, 40 factories, 27 offices, 15 parks)
- **Buildings**: 274 (generated for high-capacity POIs)
- **File Size**: 48,081 bytes
- **Population**: ~432 (estimated from homes)
- **City Area**: 100 km²

## Technical Implementation

### City Generation Algorithm
1. **Zone Generation**: Creates diverse zone types in realistic patterns
   - Downtown core with high commercial/office density
   - Residential suburbs in radial pattern
   - Commercial districts at intermediate distances
   - Industrial areas on city periphery
   - Parks distributed throughout

2. **Road Network**: Generates hierarchical road system
   - Ring highway connecting major areas
   - Arterial roads connecting zones to downtown
   - Local road grids within residential/commercial zones

3. **POI Distribution**: Places points of interest based on zone characteristics
   - Homes in residential areas (80% residential POIs)
   - Shops/restaurants in commercial areas (60% shops, 40% restaurants)
   - Offices in downtown (50% office, 50% shop)
   - Factories in industrial areas
   - Park amenities in green spaces

4. **Building Generation**: Creates buildings for high-capacity POIs (>50 capacity)
   - Realistic building types based on POI usage
   - Variable heights (30-130 units)
   - Proper building footprints

### Data Structure Features
- **Spatial Organization**: 10km x 10km city bounds (-5000 to +5000 coordinates)
- **Metadata Tracking**: Generation timestamp, seed, population, area
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive enums for zones, roads, POIs, buildings
- **Efficient Storage**: Binary protobuf format for fast loading

## Critical Bug Fixed

**Issue**: Metadata and bounds fields were not being serialized due to field name mismatch between protobuf schema (snake_case) and JavaScript object creation (camelCase).

**Solution**: Updated `scripts/generate_city.cjs` to use camelCase field names:
- `min_x` → `minX`, `max_x` → `maxX`, etc.
- `generation_timestamp` → `generationTimestamp`, etc.

**Result**: Metadata and bounds are now correctly populated in the generated protobuf file.

## Testing Results

All acceptance criteria from PLAN2 have been verified:

✅ **Schema Exists**: `src/data/city_model.proto` with complete message definitions
✅ **Compilation Success**: JavaScript files generated without errors
✅ **Script Execution**: `npm run build:city` completes successfully
✅ **Output Generation**: `public/model.pbf` created with valid size (48KB)
✅ **Data Validation**: Protobuf can be decoded and contains expected data
✅ **Content Quality**: Generated city has reasonable numbers of all components
✅ **Test Suite**: Complete PLAN2 test suite passes all checks

## Dependencies Added

**Production Dependencies**:
- `protobufjs`: ^7.5.4 (Protocol Buffers for JavaScript)
- `simplex-noise`: ^4.0.3 (Procedural noise generation)

**Development Dependencies**:
- `protobufjs-cli`: ^1.1.3 (Protocol Buffers CLI tools)

## Integration Points

The generated city model integrates with:
1. **WASM Simulation Core** (PLAN3): Reads `public/model.pbf` for simulation
2. **Visualization System**: Uses protobuf data for 3D city rendering
3. **Build Process**: Automated generation via `prebuild` script

## Performance Characteristics

- **Generation Time**: ~2-3 seconds for complete city
- **File Size**: Efficient 48KB binary format
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal during generation
- **Deterministic Output**: Same seed produces identical cities
- **Scalable**: Can easily adjust city size and complexity

## Ready for PLAN3

The procedural city generation system is fully operational and ready to provide data for the WASM simulation core implementation in PLAN3. The binary protobuf format ensures efficient loading and processing in the WebAssembly environment.
