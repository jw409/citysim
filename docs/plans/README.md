# Agentic Coding Plans

This directory contains planning documents that demonstrate **agentic coding practices** - how AI agents break down complex tasks into structured, executable plans.

## What Are These Files?

These `PLAN*.md` files are artifacts from development sessions where Claude Code was asked to solve complex problems by:

1. **Analyzing** the current state of the codebase
2. **Planning** a structured approach with clear steps
3. **Executing** the plan systematically
4. **Documenting** progress and learnings

## Agentic Coding Pattern

Each plan follows a consistent pattern:

### 1. Problem Analysis
- Understanding the current state
- Identifying specific issues or requirements
- Gathering context from existing code

### 2. Strategic Planning
- Breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps
- Prioritizing work based on dependencies
- Anticipating potential challenges

### 3. Structured Execution
- Working through tasks in logical order
- Documenting decisions and rationale
- Adapting plans based on discoveries

### 4. Knowledge Capture
- Recording what worked and what didn't
- Documenting insights for future reference
- Creating reusable patterns and practices

## Plan Evolution

The numbering shows the evolution of problem-solving approaches:

- **PLAN1-3**: Initial 3D rendering issues with deck.gl
- **PLAN4-6**: Building layer and viewport optimization
- **PLAN7-9**: Performance improvements and debugging protocols
- **PLAN10+**: Advanced features and testing infrastructure

### Special Documents

- **[VERIFICATION.md](./VERIFICATION.md)**: Comprehensive testing and validation checklist demonstrating systematic verification practices for 3D applications

## Value for Development Teams

These plans demonstrate:

- **Systematic thinking** - Breaking complex problems into steps
- **Documentation-driven development** - Planning before coding
- **Iterative refinement** - Learning from each attempt
- **Knowledge preservation** - Capturing tribal knowledge
- **Reproducible processes** - Others can follow similar patterns

## Learning from AI Collaboration

The plans show how human developers can effectively collaborate with AI by:

1. **Providing clear context** about the problem domain
2. **Asking for structured plans** before implementation
3. **Reviewing and refining** plans before execution
4. **Building on previous learnings** rather than starting fresh

## Usage in Your Projects

Consider adopting similar planning practices:

```markdown
# PLAN: [Feature/Issue Name]

## Current State
- What exists now
- What's broken or missing

## Goal
- Clear, specific objective
- Success criteria

## Strategy
- [ ] Step 1: Analysis phase
- [ ] Step 2: Design phase
- [ ] Step 3: Implementation
- [ ] Step 4: Testing & validation

## Execution Notes
- Document decisions as you go
- Note unexpected discoveries
- Update plan when needed

## Outcomes
- What was learned
- What could be improved
- Patterns for future use
```

## Future Improvements

Consider expanding this pattern with:

- **Templates** for common problem types
- **Checklists** for plan quality
- **Integration** with issue tracking
- **Metrics** on plan effectiveness

*These plans represent a collaborative approach to software development where AI agents and human developers work together systematically to solve complex problems.*
