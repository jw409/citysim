   # Show HN: UrbanSynth ‚Äì Interactive city simulator with constraint solving

   **Title**: Show HN: UrbanSynth ‚Äì Interactive city simulator with constraint solving

   **URL**: https://urbansynth.app

   **Text**:

   I've been working on UrbanSynth for the past few months - an interactive city simulator that combines real-time agent simulation with AI-powered optimization.

   What makes it unique is the constraint solver integration. You can build and modify cities, watch thousands of agents navigate with realistic daily routines, then use Google OR-Tools to find optimal locations for infrastructure like EV charging stations.

   **Technical highlights:**
   - Rust/WASM simulation engine handling 1000+ agents at 60fps
   - Beautiful 3D visualization with deck.gl and WebGL
   - Procedural city generation using Protocol Buffers
   - Client-side constraint solving with OR-Tools
   - Real-time traffic analysis and pathfinding

   **Try the demo:**
   1. Start the simulation to see agents moving
   2. Click "‚ö° Optimize EV Network" to see AI find optimal charging station locations
   3. Add buildings with the tools, then re-optimize to see solutions adapt

   The most satisfying part is watching how the optimal solutions change as you modify the city. It really shows the power of combining simulation with optimization.

   Built everything from scratch - the city generator, WASM simulation core, constraint solver integration, and React frontend. Deployed on Google Cloud Run with automated CI/CD.

   **What's next:**
   - Multi-city support
   - More optimization problems (bus routes, hospital placement, etc.)
   - Economic simulation layer
   - Multiplayer collaborative planning

   I'd love to hear your thoughts! What urban planning challenges would you want to solve with this kind of tool?

   **Expected HN Community Questions & Responses:**

   Q: "How does the performance scale with more agents?"
   A: "Currently handles 1000+ agents smoothly. The Rust/WASM core is very efficient - most bottleneck is in the visualization layer. Could probably scale to 5000+ with some optimizations."

   Q: "Why not use existing urban simulation software?"
   A: "Great question! Existing tools like SUMO are powerful but not interactive or web-based. I wanted something that anyone could try instantly in their browser, with modern UX and real-time optimization capabilities."

   Q: "Is the constraint solver actually useful or just a demo?"
   A: "It's genuinely useful! The facility location problem it solves is a classic urban planning challenge. While simplified, it demonstrates how optimization can adapt to changing conditions - something static planning tools can't do."

   Q: "What's the city generation algorithm?"
   A: "Uses a combination of techniques: noise functions for natural boundaries, L-systems for road networks, and zone-based POI placement. Nothing groundbreaking but creates believable city layouts."
   ```

   ```markdown
   # Building UrbanSynth: A Modern City Simulator with Constraint Solving

   *How I combined procedural generation, real-time simulation, and AI optimization to create an interactive urban planning tool*

   ## The Vision

   Urban planning is one of humanity's most complex challenges. Modern cities are intricate systems where thousands of individual decisions create emergent patterns of traffic, commerce, and social interaction. Traditional planning tools are either too abstract (spreadsheets and static models) or too complex (enterprise GIS software requiring years of training).

   I wanted to build something different: a city simulator that anyone could use in their browser, beautiful enough to be engaging, and powerful enough to solve real optimization problems.

   ## The Result

   [UrbanSynth](https://urbansynth.app) is an interactive city simulator that generates realistic cities, simulates thousands of autonomous agents, and uses constraint solving to find optimal solutions to urban planning challenges.

   ![UrbanSynth Screenshot](../assets/screenshot-main.png)

   ### Key Features:
   - **Procedural city generation** creates realistic urban layouts
   - **Real-time agent simulation** with 1000+ autonomous agents
   - **Interactive building tools** for modifying cities
   - **AI-powered optimization** using Google OR-Tools
   - **Beautiful 3D visualization** with day/night cycles

   ## Technical Architecture

   Building UrbanSynth required solving several interesting technical challenges:

   ### 1. High-Performance Simulation

   The simulation engine needed to handle thousands of agents in real-time. I chose Rust compiled to WebAssembly for near-native performance in the browser.

   ```rust
   pub struct Agent {
       position: Point2D,
       destination: Option<String>,
       schedule: Vec<ScheduleEntry>,
       pathfinding: PathfindingState,
   }
   ```

   Each agent has:
   - Daily schedules (home ‚Üí work ‚Üí shop ‚Üí leisure ‚Üí home)
   - Pathfinding through road networks
   - Needs-driven behavior (food, work, shopping, etc.)

   The WASM module exposes a clean JavaScript API:
   ```javascript
   simulation.init(cityData);
   simulation.tick(); // Update simulation
   const agents = simulation.getAgentStates();
   const traffic = simulation.getTrafficData();
   ```

   ### 2. Beautiful Visualization

   For rendering, I used deck.gl - a WebGL framework perfect for large-scale data visualization. Multiple layers handle different aspects:

   ```typescript
   const layers = [
     new PolygonLayer({ data: buildings, extruded: true }),
     new PathLayer({ data: roads }),
     new ScatterplotLayer({ data: agents }),
   ];
   ```

   The day/night cycle interpolates colors and lighting in real-time:

   ![Day Night Comparison](../assets/day-night-comparison.png)

   ### 3. Constraint Solving Integration

   The most interesting technical challenge was integrating Google OR-Tools for optimization. The facility location problem finds optimal placements for infrastructure (like EV charging stations) given traffic patterns.

   ```typescript
   class FacilityLocationProblem {
     solve(trafficData, config) {
       // Create optimization variables
       // Add coverage constraints
       // Maximize traffic coverage
       // Minimize placement cost
       return optimalLocations;
     }
   }
   ```

   When users click "‚ö° Optimize EV Network", the system:
   1. Analyzes current traffic patterns from the simulation
   2. Generates candidate locations near high-traffic areas
   3. Runs the constraint solver to find optimal placements
   4. Visualizes results with coverage areas

   ### 4. Procedural City Generation

   Cities are generated using a multi-step process:

   ```javascript
   1. Generate zones (downtown, residential, commercial, industrial)
   2. Create road networks connecting zones
   3. Place points of interest based on zone types
   4. Add buildings with realistic heights and footprints
   5. Serialize to Protocol Buffers for efficient loading
   ```

   The result is a believable city layout that provides interesting simulation scenarios.

   ## Development Challenges

   ### Performance Optimization

   Getting smooth 60fps with 1000+ agents required several optimizations:
   - Efficient spatial data structures for pathfinding
   - Batched rendering with deck.gl
   - Memory pooling in the WASM module
   - Level-of-detail for distant objects

   ### WASM Integration

   While WASM performance is excellent, the developer experience has rough edges:
   - Build toolchain complexity (Rust + wasm-pack + npm)
   - Memory management between JS and WASM
   - Debugging across language boundaries

   ### Constraint Solver Integration

   OR-Tools is primarily designed for server-side use. Running it in the browser required:
   - Finding/building a WASM version
   - Careful memory management for large problems
   - Progress reporting for long-running optimizations

   ## What I Learned

   ### Urban Planning is Fascinating
   Researching real urban planning challenges gave me deep appreciation for the complexity. Simple questions like "where should we put a hospital?" involve balancing accessibility, cost, traffic patterns, and community needs.

   ### WebAssembly is Ready for Complex Applications
   WASM performance is genuinely impressive. The Rust simulation core runs at near-native speed, making complex real-time simulations feasible in the browser.

   ### Constraint Programming is Underutilized
   OR-Tools makes sophisticated optimization accessible, but it's rarely used in web applications. More developers should explore constraint solving for complex decision problems.

   ### Visualization Matters
   The same simulation data becomes compelling when visualized beautifully. deck.gl transforms dry numbers into an engaging, interactive experience.

   ## Future Directions

   UrbanSynth opens many interesting possibilities:

   ### More Optimization Problems
   - Bus route optimization
   - Hospital/school placement
   - Disaster evacuation planning
   - Economic development scenarios

   ### Enhanced Simulation
   - Multi-modal transportation (buses, bikes, walking)
   - Economic modeling (supply/demand, business cycles)
   - Climate effects (weather, seasonal patterns)

   ### Collaborative Features
   - Multi-user city planning
   - Comparison of different scenarios
   - Integration with real urban data

8. **Create asset generation script** (scripts/generate-assets.js):
   ```javascript
   const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
   const fs = require('fs');
   const path = require('path');

   async function generateAssets() {
     const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
       headless: false,
       defaultViewport: { width: 1920, height: 1080 }
     });

     const page = await browser.newPage();
     await page.goto('http://localhost:5173');

     // Wait for the city to load
     await page.waitForSelector('[data-testid="city-visualization"]');
     await page.waitForTimeout(5000);

     // Create assets directory
     const assetsDir = path.join(__dirname, '../assets');
     if (!fs.existsSync(assetsDir)) {
       fs.mkdirSync(assetsDir, { recursive: true });
     }

     // Screenshot 1: Main city view
     await page.screenshot({
       path: path.join(assetsDir, 'screenshot-main.png'),
       fullPage: false
     });

     // Screenshot 2: Start simulation
     await page.click('[data-testid="play-button"]');
     await page.waitForTimeout(3000);
     await page.screenshot({
       path: path.join(assetsDir, 'screenshot-simulation.png'),
       fullPage: false
     });

     // Screenshot 3: Night mode
     await page.click('[data-testid="toggle-night"]');
     await page.waitForTimeout(2000);
     await page.screenshot({
       path: path.join(assetsDir, 'screenshot-night.png'),
       fullPage: false
     });

     // Screenshot 4: Optimization
     await page.click('[data-testid="optimize-button"]');
     await page.waitForTimeout(5000);
     await page.screenshot({
       path: path.join(assetsDir, 'screenshot-optimization.png'),
       fullPage: false
     });

     console.log('‚úÖ Screenshots generated successfully');

     await browser.close();
   }

   generateAssets().catch(console.error);
   ```
