# PLAN9: Adaptive Performance System - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

## Overview
Successfully implemented an intelligent adaptive performance scaling system that automatically optimizes CitySim's performance across all device types, from low-end phones to ultra-gaming setups.

## ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

### 1. Rust Performance Profiling System (`wasm/src/performance.rs`)
- **PerformanceProfile** struct with configurable parameters:
  - Target FPS (15-240fps)
  - Max agents (500-50,000+)
  - Render distance (200-2500m)
  - LOD levels and culling settings
- Pre-configured profiles for different device classes
- WASM-bindgen compatible interface

### 2. Device Benchmarking System (`wasm/src/benchmarking.rs`)
- **DeviceBenchmark** with comprehensive performance tests:
  - CPU benchmark using prime number calculations
  - Memory bandwidth testing
  - GPU tier detection
  - Mobile/desktop detection
- Automatic profile recommendation based on scores
- Real-time capability assessment

### 3. Adaptive Scaling Engine (`wasm/src/adaptive_scaling.rs`)
- **AdaptiveScaler** with intelligent FPS monitoring:
  - Rolling FPS history analysis
  - Performance stability detection
  - Automatic up/down scaling with 15% adjustment factors
  - Anti-thrashing protection with 3-second delays
- Real-time agent count and render distance adjustments

### 4. TypeScript Integration Layer
- **Performance types** (`src/types/performance.ts`):
  - Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
  - Device metrics and benchmark results
  - Performance state management types
- **Performance profiler utility** (`src/utils/performanceProfiler.ts`):
  - Browser API integration (GPU, memory, refresh rate detection)
  - Device capability detection
  - Performance monitoring with frame timing

### 5. React Hook System
- **usePerformanceAdaptation** (`src/hooks/usePerformanceAdaptation.ts`):
  - Automatic initialization and benchmarking
  - Real-time FPS monitoring and adaptation
  - Profile change callbacks
  - Manual overrides and settings management
- Integrated with SimulationContext for global state management

### 6. App Integration
- Performance system initialized in main App.tsx
- Agent count synchronization
- Performance state management through Redux-style context
- Real-time adaptation feedback

## üéØ Performance Scaling Tiers

| Tier | FPS | Agents | Distance | Use Case |
|------|-----|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Ultra Low** | 15fps | 500 | 200m | Potato devices, emergency fallback |
| **Low** | 30fps | 2,000 | 400m | Entry-level phones, basic laptops |
| **Medium** | 60fps | 5,000 | 600m | Mid-range devices, standard experience |
| **High** | 120fps | 15,000 | 800m | Gaming laptops, high-refresh monitors |
| **Ultra** | 240fps | 50,000+ | 1000m+ | Ultra gaming setups, 240Hz displays |

## üîß Technical Features

### Smart Device Detection
- CPU core count and performance scoring
- Memory size estimation (GB detection)
- GPU tier classification (ultra/high/medium/low)
- Refresh rate detection (30-240Hz)
- Mobile device identification

### Real-Time Adaptation
- **FPS Stability Analysis**: Only adapts when performance is stable (70%+ consistency)
- **Performance Gap Detection**: Monitors 15%+ FPS deviation from target
- **Graduated Scaling**: 15% incremental adjustments to prevent jarring changes
- **Bounds Protection**: Minimum 100 agents, maximum 100K agents

### Browser API Integration
- `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` for CPU cores
- `navigator.deviceMemory` for RAM detection
- WebGL renderer info for GPU detection
- `requestAnimationFrame` for FPS measurement
- Battery API for power state awareness

## üìä WASM Integration
- **Rust Performance**: 1.2MB WASM module with performance classes
- **JavaScript Bridge**: Seamless TypeScript/Rust communication
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized data structures and minimal allocations
- **Build Process**: Integrated with existing wasm-pack workflow

## üéÆ User Experience
- **Invisible Operation**: Adapts performance without user intervention
- **Consistent Experience**: Maintains target FPS across all device types
- **Debug Information**: Console logging for performance adaptation events
- **Manual Overrides**: Users can disable auto-scaling if desired

## ‚úÖ Build Verification
- ‚úÖ WASM compilation successful (17 warnings, 0 errors)
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation passes
- ‚úÖ Vite build generates optimized bundles
- ‚úÖ City generation and simulation work correctly
- ‚úÖ Performance system integrates with existing contexts

## üöÄ Next Steps
The adaptive performance system is now fully operational. Users will experience:

1. **Auto-Detection**: Device capabilities assessed on first load
2. **Optimal Settings**: Automatic profile selection for best experience
3. **Real-Time Scaling**: Performance adapts to maintain smooth framerates
4. **Wide Compatibility**: Works from 15fps potato devices to 240fps gaming rigs

PLAN9 successfully transforms CitySim from a fixed-performance application to an intelligent, adaptive system that provides the optimal experience on every device type.
